# Game Gauntlet
Game Gauntlet is a web-based adventure where players navigate through 
a series of interactive puzzles and challenges, inspired by real escape rooms. 
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Flask (Python) and Express.js (Node.js) for backend, 
it seamlessly blends game design, logic, and interactive storytelling into a fun, engaging challenge.
